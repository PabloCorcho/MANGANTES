MANGA New Tools for Extragalactic Statistics


This package provides:
  - basic tools to interact with MANGA 3D data cubes either locally or remotely 
    (using MARVIN https://www.sdss.org/dr16/manga/marvin/).

  - A Pipe3D class to deal with Pip3D data products 
    (https://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/manga-data/manga-pipe3d-value-added-catalog/) 
    and reconstruct star formation histories (locally).
